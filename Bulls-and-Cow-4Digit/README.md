##  Bulls and Cows 4 Digit 

Bulls and Cows is an old paper-and-pencil game for two players that involves code-breaking.

## How to play
* On a sheet of paper, each player writes a 4-digit secret number, with no repeated digits, which they must not let their opponent see, but here one player is required and has to guess the number between 1000 to 9999.
	
* The players take turns trying to guess each other's secret number. After each guess, their opponent provides feedback about the number of matches: if they guess a correct digit in the correct position, it is called a "bull," while if they match a digit but in the wrong position, it is called a "cow."

*For example, if your opponent's secret number is "1854" and you guess "4879," the feedback you will receive is: 1 bull and 1 cow ("8" is the bull, and "4" is the cow).*

* The first person to reveal their opponent's secret number wins the game.
